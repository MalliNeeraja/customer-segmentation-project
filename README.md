# Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Businesses have many customers, but not all customers behave the same. It is difficult to target all customers with the same strategy. So, we use machine learning to group customers based on their behavior.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to segment customers into different groups using unsupervised machine learning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Steps
1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Apply K-Means clustering
5. Visualize the clusters
6. Analyze the results

## Result
The customers are successfully grouped into different segments based on their behavior.
